Week 1 Minutes (March 17, 2025):

Things Done Last Week:
-Wyatt: Login/register wireframe
-Calvin: homepage wireframe
-Jack: MC quiz wireframe
-Ben: profile page wireframe
-Christina: coding exercises wireframe, start case diagram
-Kaitlyn: flashcards wireframe

Decisions made:
-Common goals:
1. API reference- mock experience?
***Coding structure and test cases
 -Mock: have questions mocked into website, one language with a few questions
 -Split: some look for API, some work on backup
2. Set up initial commit (repo)

Individual goals:
-Wyatt: Look into API, login/register skeleton, partials (e.g. nav)
-Calvin: home page UI/HTML setup
-Jack: database schema- ER diagram, MC quizzes
-Kaitlyn: flashcards page HTML/skeleton
-Ben: profile/stats page: leaderboard, points, streak(?)
-Christina: API, coding page skeleton

Alternative actions/options discussed:
-Can't find API? create two problems with 4-5 test cases, can be one language
-Scope: Think about checking code solutions manually- ex: .cpp file

Follow-up items, including agreed-on roles and responsibilities:
-Find API or look into other possibilities
-Follow-up on plan B (mockup) if API not possible
-Email TA plan (either mockup or API)

Week 2 Minutes (March 31, 2025)
Main takeaways:
-Database is really important, let's not make any more code without the database complete
-no track record for users and record the progress with the database supporting that, when a code is failing or succeeding
